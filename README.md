My code repository for my deep learning class that taught me:
- How to create KNNs, Fully-Connected Neural Nets, Convolutional Neural Nets, RNNs, LSTMs and more from scratch!
- How to use Pytorch to do the same thing (this was a breath of fresh air)
- Building computational graphs and conducting backpropogation
- Regularization techniques: Batch Normalization, LayerNorm, Dropout, etc.
- Loss functions: Hinge loss, ReLU, Leaky ReLU, etc.
- Optimization functions: SGD, SGD+momentum, RMSProp, AdaGrad, etc.
